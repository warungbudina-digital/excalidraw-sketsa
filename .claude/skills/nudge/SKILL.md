# Nudge

## Purpose

Nudge is a collaborative memory layer for agent hooks. This skill is the router:
pick the focused reference for the Nudge situation, follow it, then return to
the user's task.

## When to use

- Nudge blocks, warns about, or substitutes a tool command.
- Nudge surfaces learned repo context; use `nudge-learnings` for the focused
  debugging-memory workflow.
- The user asks what Nudge is or why it interrupted.
- The user asks to install Nudge locally or set up hooks for a repo with Nudge
  rules.
- The user asks to configure, validate, check, write, debug, or update Nudge
  rules or learned incident notes.
- The user asks to add Nudge to CI, pre-commit, or another scripted gate.
- You find `.nudge.yaml`, `.nudge.yml`, or `.nudge/` while working.

## Workflow

1. Read the Nudge output or user request closely.
2. Choose the most specific reference:
   - Hook responses, interrupts, warnings, substitutions, provider support:
     `references/hook-responses.md`
   - Local installation, hook setup, teammate cloned repo bootstrap:
     `references/setup.md`
   - Writing new rules:
     `references/rule-writing.md`
   - Noisy, silent, or surprising rules:
     `references/rule-debugging.md`
   - Validation commands and check selection:
     `references/validation.md`
   - CI, pre-commit, release gates, or scripts:
     `references/ci.md`
   - Learned incident notes and proactive debugging memory:
     use `nudge-learnings`
3. Follow that reference, then continue the user's task.

## Examples

### Example 1

Nudge blocks an edit that adds a forbidden pattern.

Expected behavior:
1. Read the Nudge message and snippet.
2. Change the edit to satisfy the rule.
3. Retry the operation.
4. Mention the rule only if it matters to the user-facing summary.

### Example 2

User says: "Add a Nudge rule that blocks npm install."

Expected behavior:
1. Read `references/rule-writing.md`.
2. Add or update the appropriate `.nudge.yaml` or `.nudge/*.yaml` rule.
3. Read `references/validation.md`.
4. Run the checks that prove the new rule parses and behaves as intended.

### Example 3

Nudge surfaces learned context from `.nudge/learned`.

Expected behavior:
1. Use `nudge-learnings`.
2. Inspect the cited note.
3. Apply it only if it matches the current situation.

### Example 4

After debugging, the agent fixes a repo-specific issue that future agents are
likely to hit again.

Expected behavior:
1. Use `nudge-learnings`.
2. Record a concise learned incident note under `.nudge/learned` with the
   symptom, root cause, fix, and verification.
3. Keep the note repo-specific; do not record generic programming advice.

### Example 5

User asks: "Why did Nudge rewrite my command?"

Expected behavior:
1. Read the substitution context from the hook response.
2. If the reason is not obvious, read `references/hook-responses.md`.
3. Explain the original command, the rewritten command, and why the rule prefers
   the rewrite.

### Example 6

User says: "This Nudge rule keeps blocking the wrong thing."

Expected behavior:
1. Read `references/rule-debugging.md`.
2. Reproduce the noisy match with `nudge test`, `nudge check`, or the smallest
   relevant hook payload.
3. Tighten the matcher or message, then rerun the proof command.

### Example 7

User says: "Add Nudge to CI."

Expected behavior:
1. Read `references/ci.md`.
2. Add a scripted `nudge check` gate without depending on live agent hooks.
3. Run the CI command locally when practical.

### Example 8

User says: "I cloned this repo and it has `.nudge.yaml`, but Nudge isn't doing
anything."

Expected behavior:
1. Read `references/setup.md`.
2. Check whether `nudge` is installed and which agent hooks are needed.
3. Run the relevant setup command from the project root.
4. Verify hooks and skills after restarting the agent session.
